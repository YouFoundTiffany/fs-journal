# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?

- What are you struggling with?
I am not able to complete any lab activity which does not allow me to learn the more complicated tasks that come towards the end of the activity. I am then only able to reach the final stages of a project in the checkpoint, which is less than ideal. Then, I am told that studying every night is not encouraged or perferred. What do you suggest?
- What would you count as a victory?
