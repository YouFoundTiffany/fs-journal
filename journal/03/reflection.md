# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I feel as though the speed has lessened bit, so that is a relief. 
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
That I am not really 'behind' by any stretch of the imagination. Yes there are a few students that are ready for week 4, or 5 even. But, the cohort as a whole is pretty well all in the same place in regards to learning. 

I figured out how to "hack" myself (my braine) figured out what is working for me and increase my retention and working stack memory. It clicked this week. Last week I thought for sure I was going to be the first one voted off the island. :D.
- What are you struggling with?
Javascript is confusing, but becoming less muddy every day. 
- What would you count as a victory?
I didn't finish any of the labs to my level of satisfaction, but I learned more this week than last.
