# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > We use Git to push our code to a source control. 

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > Make a new directory or a new folder.

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    >Pseudo-classes are a reactive styles that can be added to a selector in CSS with the use of a colon and a keyword.

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > Specificity is the rank or score a particular style declaration has in css, which determines what actual styling is applied to an element.

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > The !Important signifier is used to override all specificity ranks. I can quickly cause debugging issues due to the nature of css hierarchies and the natural 

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    >All CSS rules must have the following to work correctly, a selector, a property, and a value. A selector identifies which HTML element(s) is being styled, for example, the h1 header. A property specifies the characteristics of the HTML element that is being styled, like color. A value determines the nature of the styling, for example, this specific color of yellow #FFCC33. 


07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > Good design 

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > Wireframing creates a model or mockup of a project. The purpose is to move from low to high-fidelity concepts and provide clear communication to the customer, team, project members, and the customer in each phase.  

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > Absolutely yes. Every project/customer proposal should include a wireframe in the contract and spec sheet. This documentation will show what is needed and what is planned to complete all deliverables. 

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    >The flex property allows for elements to be displayed as a flexible box model. You can then arrange in a row or a column. 

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > Height, width, which includes padding but not margin.
